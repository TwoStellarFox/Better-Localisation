# Better-Localisation

This mod contains all the changes in Better Localisation — country, war, and other edits — and is perfect if you want the full mod experience.

I've grown tired of the way Paradox localises some of their stuff lately, and I figured I might as well share a mod that changes them. Many popular wars never had the name of the province they were warring for in the name of the war itself, so this fixes that by changing war names to be a bit more...satisfactory; almost like they belong on a Wikipedia article. Not only does it change war names, but it changes country names as well. My goal with this mod is to make some of the more noticable localisation in EUIV a bit better, while focusing on historical aspects, my own personal issues with the localisation, and user suggestions.
